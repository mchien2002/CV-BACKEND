            <h2>INTRODUCE MYSELT</h2>
            I am a student in the Information Technology department at Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology and Education with a passion for mobile application development. I have had a 6-month internship experience in the front-end Flutter position, during which I had the opportunity to explore the concept of back-end development. It was through this experience that I realized my interest and suitability for a back-end role. Therefore, I would like to apply for a back-end position at your company to further enhance my skills and experience in this field, while contributing value to the company. I believe my current strengths lie in my ability to learn quickly and my strong logical thinking. Additionally, I have gained practical experience through participating in three real-world projects at my previous company, namely: LOMO (Social network for the LGBT community), CNQ COFFE (Online food ordering app), and HURA (Chat app).

                    Talk Wave is a personal online chat application built using Java Spring Boot. This project allowed me to apply my knowledge of Java and Spring Boot in developing APIs for sending and receiving messages, managing user accounts, and authentication. I had the opportunity to work independently and solve technical challenges throughout the project development.
